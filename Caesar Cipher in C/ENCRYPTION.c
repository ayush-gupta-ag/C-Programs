[Encryption & Decryption]

The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. 
Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions (shift) down the alphabet.
For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.

THIS CODE IS FOR ENCRYPTION.
